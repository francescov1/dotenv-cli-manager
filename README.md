## In Development

This project is in the early stages of development. Here's a few things in the roadmap:
- user-provided config for file paths & formats
- walk-through project setup
- remote file editing

# Known bugs

- after editing a value, the table is re-rendered below, rather than rendering in place
- after editing a value, the value's preview length will show its previous length until show/hide is toggled
